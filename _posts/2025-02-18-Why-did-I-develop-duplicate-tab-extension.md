### Android Firefox does not have this button, which is inconvenient.

Originally, if you want to copy a tab, you need to copy the URL and paste it to the new tab, which is very troublesome. So I developed the [duplicate tab extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duplicate-tab-for-fx-mobile/) , which allows you to duplicate tabs by just clicking the duplicate tab button. Later I integrated it to [Show Close Tab Button](/).
