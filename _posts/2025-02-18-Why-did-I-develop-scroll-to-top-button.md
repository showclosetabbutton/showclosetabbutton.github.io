### Because I don't want to keep scrolling

- It would be nice if I could press a button to return to the beginning or end of a web page.
- It is not easy to scroll to the exact page when reading an article. It would be convenient if there was a button that could take you to the previous or next page.
- When using AI chatbot, if you can press a button in the conversation area, you can go to the beginning or end of the conversation and the previous or next page. This saves you time scrolling through conversations.
